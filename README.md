# Study Management Program

## Overview

The Study Management Program is a Java-based application designed to help students practice and improve their skills by solving problems tailored to their level. The program uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to recommend problems to students based on their proficiency in different topics and the difficulty of the problems.

## Features

- **Problem Recommendation:** Utilizes the KNN algorithm to match students' skill levels with appropriate problem difficulties.
- **Class Management:** Allows teachers to create classes and invite students.
- **Assignment Creation:** Teachers can assign tasks to students.
- **Automated Grading:** Problems are automatically graded using the ChatGPT API, providing immediate feedback to students.
- **User Interface:** Built with Swing UI for a user-friendly experience.
